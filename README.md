# Ant Colony Optimization

The purpose of this project is to show the use of **ACO** (**A**nt **C**olony **O**ptimization)
methods in minimizations problems. ACO is applied on problems that can be reduced to finding paths 
through graphs, so this implementation targets directly one of the well known cases - **Travelling
Salesman Problem**. Since **ACO** may not find the optimal solution, alogside it there is a backtrack
algorithm implementation for comparison.

Another swarm intelligence based algorithm can be found here - 
[Particle Swarm Optimization](https://github.com/Iulian-Stan/ParticleSwarmOptimization).

## Solution

By running the application it can be seen that the system places the ants in differenc cities (points), 
each one trying to find a path. Combining the solutions, the application iteratively produces the 
best one (**!** it does not mean that the solution is optimal).
